                        <p>Condé Nast Traveler relaunched their website with a new approach to their content and a design refresh to go along with it. This vision work was used as inspiration for the internal team working on the redesign. Leveraging CNT’s incredibly rich content library, we married moments of bold imagery with subtle graphic details to design an experience meant to feel like a curated gallery of travel destinations.</p>

                        <p>Mary Review is a magazine of news and ideas written and produced entirely by women. Our goal was to bring parity to the wider journalistic conversation. Initially funded by Kickstarter, Mary grew from print and online content to events and fundraisers supporting women's rights affected by the political climate. As Design Director, I was responsible for the identity, print edition, website, editorial art direction, fundraising decks, marketing collateral, and overall brand aesthetic. In 2016, our website was selected for permanent inclusion in the Library of Congress Web Archives.</p>

It’s a small group of agencies who combine their individual capabilities to do work for social change. Our team developed the website as a digital extension of the brand system Interbrand had designed.</p>

                        <p>North is a location-based mobile app that helps you discover meaningful places in nature through the stories of others. By aggregating locations and personal experiences from its users, North creates a curated database of places in nature from around the world. While we often fault the digital world for our lack of engagement with the outdoors, North explores how technology can be used to bring us closer to nature. <br><br> This concept project was developed over one year and is comprised of a business plan, identity and visual design, experience design, pitch book, marketing materials, video, and a public pitch presentation as thesis requirements of the MFA Design Entrepreneurship program at the School of Visual Arts.</p>
